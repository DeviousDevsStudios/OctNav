# OctNav Documentation

OctNav is a powerful Unity tool for efficient navigation and pathfinding within your game environments. It leverages an octree-based system for precise and performant agent movement.

## Installation

Install OctNav from the Unity Package Manager using the following Git URL:

[https://github.com/DeviousDevsStudios/OctNav.git](https://github.com/DeviousDevsStudios/OctNav.git)



## 1. OctNav Window

The main OctNav window provides a central hub for managing your navigation volumes, building octrees, and visualizing navigation data.

The OctNav Window - Build Tab

![OctWindowBuild](https://github.com/DeviousDevsStudios/OctNav/blob/main/SampleImages/OctWindowBuild.png?raw=true)

### 1.1 Build Tab

This tab is used for creating and managing your OctVolumes and initiating the octree build process.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|--|--|
| **Refresh** | Refreshes the Target Volume List |
| **Target Volume** | Selects the specific `OctVolume` you want to work with, or choose "All Volumes" to apply actions across all defined volumes. |
| **Create New OctVolume** | Creates a new `OctVolume` GameObject in your scene, which defines the boundaries for your navigation data. |
| **Build Selected Volume** | Initiates the octree generation for the currently selected `OctVolume` (or all volumes if "All Volumes" is selected). |
| **Reset Selected Volume** | Clears the generated octree data for the selected `OctVolume`. |
| **Important Note:** |  OctNav recommends using convex shapes for geometry near octree edges to avoid potential mispathing issues. |

## 2. OctBuilder Component

The `OctBuilder` component is typically attached to a GameObject and provides an alternative way to build the octree for a specific `OctVolume`.

_The OctBuilder Component in the Inspector_

### 2.1 Usage Example

Here is an example of how to use the `OctBuilder` component to build a navigation graph:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using OctNav;

public class MyBuilderScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    public OctBuilder octBuilder;

    void Start()
    {
        // Ensure the OctBuilder component is assigned in the inspector.
        // Or get it from the GameObject if it's on the same one.
        octBuilder = GetComponent<OctBuilder>();

        // Before calling Build(), you must ensure the BoundsHandles
        // component (which is required by OctBuilder) has its bounds
        // properly defined in the editor.
        // Once the bounds are set, you can trigger the build process:
        octBuilder.Build();
        Debug.Log("Octree Navigation Graph Built!");
    }
}

```

### 2.2 Public Functions Reference

This section documents all public functions available in the `OctBuilder` class.


| **Function Signature** | **Description** | **Parameters** | **Example Usage** |
|--|--|--|--|

| **Fade Start Distance** | The distance at which gizmo fading begins. |
| **Fade End Distance** | The distance at which gizmos are fully faded out. |
| **Build Octrees** | Manually triggers the octree build for this volume (calls `BuildChildren()`). |
| **Reset** | Clears the generated octree data for this volume (calls `ResetOctree()`). |


### 3.1 Usage Example

Here is an example of how to build the octree volume dynamically using `BuildChildren()`:

```csharp
public OctVolume volume;

public void UpdateVolume()
{
    // Build the volume at runtime if major scene changes occur
    volume.BuildChildren();
}

```

### 3.2 Public Functions Reference

This section documents all public functions available in the `OctVolume` class.


| **Function Signature** | **Description** | **Parameters** | **Returns** | **Example Usage** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `SaveOctree()` | Saves the current octree structure to disk. The octree data is stored in a JSON format within a specific directory relative to your Unity project (`SceneData/OctreeData/`). | None | None | `csharp public OctVolume octVolume; void SaveCurrentOctree() { octVolume.SaveOctree(); Debug.Log("Octree saved successfully."); }` |
| `LoadOctree()` | Attempts to load a previously saved octree from disk. If a saved octree is found and successfully loaded, it will rebuild the navigation graphs (both the general graph and the walkable grounded graph) based on the loaded data. | None | `bool` - `true` if the octree was successfully loaded; `false` otherwise. | `csharp public OctVolume octVolume; void Start() { if (octVolume.LoadOctree()) { Debug.Log("Octree loaded from file."); } else { Debug.LogWarning("No existing octree found or failed to load. Building a new one."); octVolume.BuildChildren(); // Fallback to building if load fails } }` |
| `BuildChildren()` | Builds a new octree from the geometry (defined by `geometryMask`) located inside the current bounds of the `OctVolume`. This is the primary function to generate the octree structure and its associated navigation graphs from scratch. It also handles setting colliders to convex temporarily during the build process if `setCollidersToConex` is enabled. | None | None | `csharp public OctVolume octVolume; void RebuildNavigation() { Debug.Log("Starting octree rebuild..."); octVolume.BuildChildren(); Debug.Log("Octree rebuild complete."); }` |
| `GetEmptyLeaves(OctNode node)` | Recursively finds all empty (non-colliding) leaf nodes within the octree starting from a given `OctNode` and adds them to the `emptyLeaves` list. These empty leaves represent navigable space. | `node`: The starting `OctNode` for the recursive search. | None | _This function is primarily called internally by OctVolume during the build process. You typically wouldn't need to call it directly._ |
| `BuildGraph()` | Adds empty leaf nodes and their connections (face links) to the main `OctNavigation.graph`. This function effectively constructs the primary navigation graph that agents can use for pathfinding. | None | None | _This function is primarily called internally by OctVolume during the build and load processes. You typically wouldn't need to call it directly._ |
| `BuildWalkableGraph()` | Builds the grounded navigation graph (`OctNavigation.groundGraph`) specifically for surface walking. It identifies "walkable" nodes (nodes with collision that have an empty node above them) and connects them, including handling steps and edges. | None | None | _This function is primarily called internally by OctVolume during the build and load processes. You typically wouldn't need to call it directly._ |
| `ResetOctree()` | Resets all internal octree data and navigation graphs associated with this volume. This clears all calculated nodes and connections, effectively preparing the volume for a new build or load operation. It also repaints the Scene View in the editor. | None | None | `csharp public OctVolume octVolume; void ResetData() { octVolume.ResetOctree(); Debug.Log("Octree data reset."); }` |
| `BuildSection(Bounds sectionBounds)` | Allows for rebuilding a specific section of the octree. This is useful for dynamic environments where only parts of the navigation mesh might change. It subdivides nodes within the `sectionBounds`, then rebuilds the affected graph parts. | `sectionBounds`: The `Bounds` defining the area to rebuild within the octree. | None | `csharp public OctVolume octVolume; public Vector3 centerOfChange; void UpdateDynamicArea() { Bounds changedArea = new Bounds(centerOfChange, new Vector3(10, 10, 10)); octVolume.BuildSection(changedArea); Debug.Log($"Section around {centerOfChange} rebuilt."); }` | `FindNodeAtPoint(Vector3 point)` | Finds and returns the specific `OctNode` that contains the given `Vector3` point within this `OctVolume`'s octree. | `point`: The `Vector3` position to search for within the octree. | `OctNode` - The `OctNode` that contains the point, or `null` if no node at that point is found or the root is null. | `csharp public OctVolume octVolume; public Transform playerTransform; void Update() { OctNode nodeUnderPlayer = octVolume.FindNodeAtPoint(playerTransform.position); if (nodeUnderPlayer != null) { Debug.Log($"Player is in octree node at: {nodeUnderPlayer.bounds.center}"); } }` |
| `DrawNodeGizmo(OctNode node, bool hitPass = false)` | This function is responsible for drawing gizmos for individual octree nodes in the Unity editor. It applies distance fading based on the camera's position and can draw either the overall octree structure or highlight collision nodes. This is an internal helper for the `OnDrawGizmos` and `OnDrawGizmosSelected` methods. | `node`: The `OctNode` to draw gizmos for. `hitPass`: A `bool` indicating if this pass is for drawing "hit" (colliding) gizmos. | None | _This function is used internally by the OctVolume to visualize the octree in the editor. You typically wouldn't call this directly from your scripts._ |
